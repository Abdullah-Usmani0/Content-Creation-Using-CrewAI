## How It Works

The app relies on a multi-agent setup using CrewAI to implement distinct roles:

1. **Research Analyst Agent**: 
   - Gathers relevant information by scraping the web based on the input topic. 
   - Utilizes tools like `SerperDevTool` to ensure the latest information is retrieved from various online sources.

2. **Data Insights Agent**: 
   - Analyzes the data collected to extract key insights and trends relevant to the topic. 
   - Provides context and data-driven support for content creation.

3. **Content Director Agent**: 
   - Creates engaging, topic-centered content from the insights gathered. 
   - Ensures that the generated content aligns with the target audience's needs and expectations.

4. **Quality Review Agent**: 
   - Refines the output to ensure high quality and relevance.
   - Conducts checks to maintain brand voice and optimize the content for various platforms.

Each agent operates collaboratively, leveraging their specific strengths to produce well-rounded content in a matter of seconds. The integration of web scraping allows for real-time data gathering, ensuring that the content generated is not only timely but also relevant.

## Usage

Enter your topic in the appâ€™s sidebar, and it will automatically generate a series of social media posts and an article. The generated content is structured for readability and engagement, suitable for direct publishing or as a draft for further customization.
